	abstract="Clinical data interoperability requires shared specifications of meaning. This is the rationale for clinical data standards. Up until now, the adoption of such standards has been varied, although they are increasingly advocated in an area where proprietary specifications prevail, and semantic resources are geared to specific purposes and limited by boundaries of languages and jurisdictions. This chapter highlights the need of data standards in the context of the difficult and heterogeneous field of clinical data and the way how they are addressed by terminologies, ontologies and information models. It provides an overview of existing standards and discusses quality and implementation issues. Emphasis is also put on the eStandards methodology, which investigates needs for health data standards, supports the creation of standardised artefacts and defines actions for the implementation of standards.",

	abstract="There is rapidly growing momentum for web enabled agents that reason about and dynamically integrate the appropriate knowledge and services at run-time. The dynamic integration of knowledge and services depends on the existence of explicit declarative semantic models (ontologies). We have been building tools for ontology development based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). This allows the many mature UML tools, models and expertise to be applied to knowledge representation systems, not only for visualizing complex ontologies but also for managing the ontology development process. UML has many features, such as profiles, global modularity and extension mechanisms that are not generally available in most ontology languages. However, ontology languages have some features that UML does not support. Our paper identifies the similarities and differences (with examples) between UML and the ontology languages RDF and DAML+OIL. To reconcile these differences, we propose a modification to the UML metamodel to address some of the most problematic differences. One of these is the ontological concept variously called a property, relation or predicate. This notion corresponds to the UML concepts of association and attribute. In ontology languages properties are first-class modeling elements, but UML associations and attributes are not first-class. Our proposal is backward-compatible with existing UML models while enhancing its viability for ontology modeling. While we have focused on RDF and DAML+OIL in our research and development activities, the same issues apply to many of the knowledge representation languages. This is especially the case for semantic network and concept graph approaches to knowledge representations.",
